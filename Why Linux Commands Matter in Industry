High Industry Demand:
  Over 90% of cloud infrastructure runs on Linux (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
  Most web servers use Linux (Apache, Nginx)
  All Android devices run on Linux kernel
  Supercomputers, IoT devices, networking equipment predominantly use Linux
  DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and SRE roles require strong Linux skills

    curl - API testing
    tail -f - Real-time log monitoring
    chmod - Setting file permissions


Most Valuable Commands by Usage Frequency

  Daily Use (80% of work):
    ssh - Remote server access
    ls, cd, pwd - Navigation
    grep - Searching logs/files
    tail - Monitoring logs
    systemctl - Service management
    docker - Container management
    git - Version control
    vim/nano - Editing config files
    cat, less - Viewing files
    chmod, chown - Permissions

  Weekly/Regular Use:
    ps, top, htop - Performance checks
    df, du - Disk space monitoring
    find - Locating files
    tar, gzip - Backups
    curl, wget - Downloads/API calls
    awk, sed - Text processing
    cron - Scheduled tasks

  As-Needed but Critical:
    iptables - Firewall rules

    strace, lsof - Deep debugging
    fsck, fdisk - Disk issues
    sar, vmstat - Performance analysis


Career Impact
  Salary Perspective:
    DevOps Engineers: $90k-$150k+ (Linux skills required)
    System Administrators: $60k-$100k+
    Cloud Engineers: $100k-$160k+
    Site Reliability Engineers: $120k-$180k+

  Job Requirements:
    90%+ of DevOps job postings require Linux expertise
    Cloud certifications (AWS, Azure, GCP) assume Linux knowledge
    Kubernetes administration is impossible without Linux skills


My Recommendation
  Focus on these first (80/20 rule):
    File navigation: ls, cd, pwd, find, grep
    Text processing: cat, less, tail, head, awk, sed
    Process management: ps, top, kill
    Permissions: chmod, chown
    Networking: ssh, curl, ping
    Package management: apt/yum/dnf
    Version control: git
    Text editors: vim or nano

  Then expand to:
    Docker/container commands
    System services: systemctl
    Advanced networking: netstat, ss, iptables
    Monitoring: htop, iotop, journalctl
